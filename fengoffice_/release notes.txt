OpenGoo alpha 0.4 release notes
===============================

Finally, OpenGoo release alpha 0.4 is out!

New to this release is the inclusion of the new slideshow editor, Slimey.
Slimey is an open source, web based, slideshow editor born from the OpenGoo
project. This first version includes basic slideshow editing functionality
but shows a promising future and even now has many great features planned
in its roadmap. Currently, Fiefox 2, IE 7 and Safari 3 are all fully supported
and it works correctly on Opera 9 with some small bugs.

Other improvements to this version of OpenGoo include fixing a bug which didn't
allow you to change the active project, together with some other small bug fixes.

For the next version we wil focus on bug fixing and a lot of work under the hood.

If you would like to help OpenGoo become a fully featured web office, please

knowledge you can contribute by reporting bugs or giving your opinion at our
