    System requirements
    ===================

    OpenGoo requires a web server, PHP (5.0 or greater) and MySQL (InnoDB
    support recommended). The recommended web server is Apache.

    OpenGoo is not PHP4 compatible and it will not run on PHP versions prior
    to PHP5.

    Recommended:

    PHP 5.2+
    MySQL 4.1+ with InnoDB support
    Apache 2.0+

        * PHP    : http://www.php.net/
        * MySQL  : http://www.mysql.com/
        * Apache : http://www.apache.org/

    Alternatively, if you just want to test OpenGoo and you don't care about security
    issues with your files, you can download XAMPP, which includes all that is needed
    by OpenGoo (Apache, PHP 5, MySQL) in a single download.
    You can configure MySQL to support InnoDB by commenting or removing
    the line 'skip-innodb' in the file '<INSTALL_DIR>/etc/my.cnf'.

        * XAMPP  : http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp


    Installation
    ============

    1. Download OpenGoo - http://www.opengoo.org/
    2. Unpack and upload to your web server
    3. Direct your browser to the public/install directory and follow the installation
    procedure

    You should be finished in a matter of minutes.
    
    WARNING: Default memory limit por PHP is 8MB. As a new OpenGoo install consumes about 10 MB,
    administrators could get a message similar to "Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted".
    This can be solved by setting "memory_limit=32" in php.ini.    
    
    
    Upgrading OpenGoo
    =================
	Each new release of OpenGoo upgrades only from the previous release.
	For example, in order to upgrade to version 1.0 from version 0.8 you must run
	the upgrade procedure two times, first from 0.8 to 0.9 and then from 0.9 to 1.0. 
    
    
    Upgrade instructions from 1.0
    =============================
    
    1. Backup you current installation (important !)
    2. Download OpenGoo 1.1 beta - http://www.opengoo.org/
    3. Unpack into your OpenGoo installation, overwriting your previous files and folders,
    	but keeping your config and upload folders.
    5. In your browser, go to <your_opengoo>/public/upgrade and choose to upgrade from 1.0 to 1.1.
    6. If necessary, refresh your browser or clear its cache so that the new javascript, css and images load.
    
    NOTE: Because of OpenGoo email's BETA status we have chosen to hide email by default. If you want to enable
    email again in your installation you just need to set SHOW_MAILS_TAB to true in config/config.php.
    You can do this by adding the following line before the "return true;" line:
    	define('SHOW_MAILS_TAB', true);
