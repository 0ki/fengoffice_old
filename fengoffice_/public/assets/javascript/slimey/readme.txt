Slimey is an open source web-based slideshow editor. Slimey aims to be simple but yet provide the most common features you would expect from a slideshow editor. Slimey aims to be compatible with most of the newer web browsers.

The first version will provide basic functionality and the ability to create, edit and present slideshows in it's own format (SLIM), based on html, css and javascript. It's a desirable feature to allow interoperability with other existing slideshow formats.

Slimey was born as part of the OpenGoo web office project, but was made a seperate project to let it evolve it's own way and better benefit the open source community.

Slimey is an acronym for (SLIdeshow Microformat Editor (the 'Y' just adds the cute factor ;).
