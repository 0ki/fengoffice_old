<h1>Quick Start Guide</h1>

<div id="page1" class="page">
<h2>Step 1 - Install OpenGoo</h2>
<p>Installing OpenGoo is easy. Just transfer all files to your webspace - our 4-step-wizard will walk you through the rest of the installation procedure. For details, please refer to the installation guide.</p>
</div>

<div id="page2" class="page">
<h2>Step 2 - Create an administrator account</h2>
<p>Immediately after the 4-step-wizard you will be asked to create a user account and provide a company name. The user account will give you access to OpenGoo as an administrator. The company will become the owner company of the OpenGoo installation.</p>
</div>

<div id="page3" class="page">
<h2>Step 3 - Log into OpenGoo</h2>
<p>That's an easy one: Just enter the user name and password you defined in step 2.</p>
</div>

<div id="page4" class="page">
<h2>Step 4 - Create more companies and user accounts</h2>
<p>When you log into OpenGoo for the first time you will see the welcome message on the dashboard. This is a little guide about what to do next:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enter more details about your company.</li>
    <li>Add accounts for other people working in your company. You can make OpenGoo send them an e-mail with their account information, so they can join you immediately.</li>
    <li>Add client companies. (If you have partner companies or subcontractors, treat them as client companies.)</li>
    <li>Create your first project. (We will discuss this in more detail in a minute.)</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="page5" class="page">
<h2>Step 5 - Create a project and set permissions</h2>
<p>Creating a project is basically a matter of entering a name and a description. When you save the project, OpenGoo will ask you which other users should get access permission to it. For your collegues (i.e. people working for the same company) this is simply a question of yes or no. For your clients, partners and subcontractors you can specify in more detail what they are allowed to do.</p>
</div>

<div id="page6" class="page">
<h2>Step 6 - Create some milestones</h2>
<p>Project management is about getting things done in a specified amount of time. So the first thing you will usually do when you start managing your project is defining some milestones. This is important because you will later assign task lists and messages to milestones, so you have to create the milestones first.</p>
<p>When you create a milestone you can assign it to a whole company or a single user. By the way: It's a good idea to check "Send email notification to user" so everybody is informed if he or she is in charge of something.</p>
</div>

<div id="page7" class="page">
<h2>Step 7 - Create some task lists (and tasks)</h2>
<p>Now let's specify what has to be done. Create at least one task list and enter some tasks. It's your choice if you assign the task list to a milestone. But you should absolutely assign each task to a user, because otherwise nobody will take care of these tasks.</p>
</div>

<div id="page8" class="page">
<h2>Step 8 - Create some messages</h2>
<p>OpenGoo is about collaboration, and collaboration is about communication. So create a message, welcome everybody to the project, tell something about the project and the people working on it, and give some directions about how people should use the tool.</p>
</div>

<div id="page9" class="page">
<h2>Step 9 - Create or upload files</h2>
<p>It's a good practice to store all relevant documents in one place. OpenGoo offers a simple document management system, that lets you upload files that are crucial for the project or even create them on the embedded document editors. And if you update a document: Don't simply overwrite the old version but create a new version to have a history of all changes.</p>
</div>

<div id="page10" class="page">
<h2>Step 10 - Explore advanced features like tags, private messages, and forms</h2>
<p>If you got that far we are confident that you will find your way through OpenGoo on your own. Simply explore tagging, private messages, forms, and other things the software has to offer. And if you need some more background information, why don't you read about the <a class="internalLink" href="help/concepts.html">basic concepts of OpenGoo</a>?</p>
