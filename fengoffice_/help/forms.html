<h2>What are forms?</h2>
<p>Forms are small tool that lets you automate some tasks (task creation or comment submission) 
without giving full control of the objects (as task lists or messages) to other users. 
<h2>Example</h2>
For instance, you want to be able to let your client submit bug reports. 
You have a Bugs task lists just for that purpose. 
Instead of granting your users access to tasks section or explaining them 
how to use it you can just create a form and point them to the "Report a bug" 
link on project overview page and you are done. 
Text they enter will be submitted as a task to the selected task lists. 
Forms can post comments on messages, if you need that kind of behavior.
<br>
<h2>Options</h2>
When form is marked as enabled it can be submited. If it is marked as visible it will be listed on the project overview page in Forms section.
